Android application to track your book collection.

Main goal is to quickly look up which books you have/need when in the bookstore.

Uses DataCrow (http://www.DataCrow.net) as the main source, and imports data from this application.
Uses DropBox (http://www.DropBox.com) to pull the export file from DataCrow into the Android App.

Still in development. ^^

Update Sept 02 - 2012
New version under the BookList2 project - see README in new version https://github.com/RobvanB/BookList2
